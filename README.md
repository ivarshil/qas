## **QUICK ATTENDANCE SYSTEM**


**Problem Statement:**
- The current method that institutions uses is the faculty passes an attendance sheet or make
roll calls and mark the attendance of the students, which sometimes disturbs the discipline of the
class and this sheet further goes to the admin department, which is then updated to an excel
sheet. This process is quite hectic and time-consuming. Also, for professors or employees at
institutes or organizations, the biometric system serves one at a time. So, why not shift to an
automated attendance system which works on face recognition technique? Be it a classroom or
entry gates it will mark the attendance of the students, professors, employees, etc.

**Solution:**
- To overcome the problems in the existing attendance system we shall develop a
Biometric based attendance system over simple attendance system. There are many solutions to
automate the attendance management system like thumb based system, simple computerized
attendance system, Iris scanner, but all these systems have limitations overwork and security
point of view. Our proposed system shall be a “Face Recognition Attendance System” which
uses the basic idea of image processing which is used in many security applications like banks,
airports, Intelligence agencies etc.

**Outcomes:**
- It will mark attendance of the students via face Id.
- It will detect the faces via wireless camera (IP camera)/webcam and then recognize the faces.
- After recognition, it will mark the attendance of the recognized student and update the attendance record.
- The admin will be able to print these record details afterward.
- The students will also receive an email on low attendance rate.
